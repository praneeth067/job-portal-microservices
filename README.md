# Job Portal Microservices Architecture (Spring Boot)

A microservices-based Job Portal backend application built using Spring Boot.  
The system is divided into independent services for Job, Company, and Review management, following the database-per-service pattern with centralized configuration using Spring Cloud Config Server.

## 🚀 Architecture Overview

This project follows a distributed microservices architecture:

- Job Service – Manages job postings
- Company Service – Manages company details
- Review Service – Manages job/company reviews
